🔗 📡 Task 05 – Network Packet Analyzer (Packet Sniffer)

🔗 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Network Packet Analyzer (Packet Sniffer) developed using Python as part of a cybersecurity internship task.
The tool captures live network traffic and analyzes packets to extract meaningful information such as IP addresses, protocols, ports, and payload data.
Packet sniffing is a fundamental concept in cybersecurity, networking, and SOC analysis, and this project is designed to build a strong foundation in understanding how data moves across networks.
This project is strictly created for educational and ethical purposes only.

🔗 🧠 Problem Statement

Understanding network traffic is critical for:
Detecting suspicious activity
Troubleshooting network issues
Learning how attacks like MITM, sniffing, and spoofing work
Building skills required for SOC Analyst roles
This project solves that by providing a simple, readable packet analyzer built from scratch using Python.

🔗🎯 Objectives of the Project

Learn how packet sniffers work internally
Capture real-time packets from the network
Extract useful information from raw packets
Understand protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP
Strengthen knowledge of networking and cybersecurity fundamentals
Practice ethical usage of security tools

🔗 🛠️ Technologies and Tools Used

Python 3
Socket Programming / Scapy library (depending on implementation)
Linux / Windows terminal
Basic understanding of:
TCP/IP model
Networking concepts
Ports and protocols

🔗⚙️ Features of the Packet Sniffer

Captures live network packets
Displays:
Source IP address
Destination IP address
Protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
Source and destination ports
Packet payload (raw data)
Simple command-line interface
Lightweight and easy to understand
Designed for learning and practice

🔗 📚 What I Learned From This Project

Through this task, I gained practical understanding of:
How network packets are structured
How data travels between devices
Difference between TCP, UDP, and ICMP
Packet inspection techniques
Python usage in cybersecurity projects
Real-world relevance of packet sniffers in SOC environments
Importance of ethical responsibility when working with security tools
This project strengthened my foundation for roles like:
SOC Analyst
Cybersecurity Analyst
Network Security Engineer

🔗 ⚠️ Ethical Use Disclaimer

This project is developed strictly for educational purposes.
Using packet sniffers on networks without permission is illegal and unethical.
Always:
Use this tool on your own network
Get proper authorization before testing
Follow cybersecurity ethics
